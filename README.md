# Rasdaman

This repository is a replication of Rasdaman repository on 14 september 2020 and is not synchronized with the forked repository.
This repository doesn't include any change from the original repository except this README file.

Note that Rasdaman can be used embedded in other systems as long as GPL and LGPL regulations are adhered to following the details provided below.

## Code License

The rasdaman community code is licensed in a way to allow use of the system in virtually any-license software systems:

​LGPL ​version 3 for the client libraries (such as libraslib.a) and applications (such as rasql) as well as the OGC frontends (aka petascope); see file COPYING.LESSER in the source tree root.
​GPL ​version 3 for server-side executables (such as rasserver and rasmgr); see file COPYING in the source tree root.
Check the standard header in each file in the source tree to determine its respective license scheme.

Why This Dual Scheme? In short: For maximizing both free use and community return. We chose GPL for the server because

Life is a give and take, and we believe that open-source is about sharing by and among all those who benefit.
A ​commercially supported, non-GPL-restricted variant of rasdaman is available which we recommend to all users who have requirements that go beyond GPL. Please ​contact the company for details.
rasdaman can be used embedded in other systems as well: the LGPL client connectors allow for an uninhibited inclusion (such as linking) of the rasdaman client libraries with code of any licensing model, including proprietary, as long as LGPL regulations are adhered to.

Why do code suppliers have to accept the Rasdaman Contribution Agreement? Because we need to maintain a strict code provenance in order to allow us to rightfully make this code available under the conditions stated above. In other words: should there be some code which conflicts with the GPL / LGPL regulations we claim then you, as a user of rasdaman, would run the risk of possibly getting "infected" by incompatible licenses. Organizations like ​Open Source Geo Foundation, OSGeo check this for open-source projects, and we indeed are undergoing a detailed provenance review (on single file granularity!) during ​rasdaman's OSGeo incubation.
